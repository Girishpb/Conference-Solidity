# Conference-Solidity
This code represents a smart contract called "Conference" written in Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum blockchain. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality:

1. The contract starts with a declaration of a few variables:
   - `organizer`: Stores the address of the contract deployer or organizer.
   - `registrantsPaid`: A mapping that associates the addresses of registrants with the amount they have paid.
   - `numRegistrants`: Keeps track of the number of people who have registered for the conference.
   - `quota`: Represents the maximum number of registrants allowed.

2. Two event declarations:
   - `Deposit`: Used to log the event when a registrant deposits funds (buys a ticket).
   - `Refund`: Used to log the event when a refund is issued.

3. The constructor function `Conference()`: It is executed once when the contract is deployed. It sets the `organizer` to the address of the contract deployer, initializes the `quota` to 100, and sets the initial number of registrants (`numRegistrants`) to 0.

4. The `buyTicket()` function: This function allows people to buy tickets for the conference. It first checks if the number of registrants has reached the specified `quota`. If so, it throws an exception, preventing further ticket purchases. If not, it records the amount sent by the buyer (`msg.value`) in the `registrantsPaid` mapping for their address, increments the `numRegistrants`, and emits a `Deposit` event.

5. The `changeQuota(uint newquota)` function: Only the organizer can invoke this function. It allows the organizer to change the conference's quota by specifying a new value for `quota`.

6. The `refundTicket(address recipient, uint amount)` function: Only the organizer can invoke this function. It refunds the specified `amount` of funds to the `recipient` address. First, it checks if the caller is the organizer and if the registrant has paid an amount equal to `amount`. If both conditions are met, it checks if the contract's balance (`myAddress.balance`) is sufficient to fulfill the refund. If so, it sends the `amount` to the recipient address, emits a `Refund` event, resets the registrant's payment to 0, and decrements the `numRegistrants`.

7. The `destroy()` function: Only the organizer can invoke this function. It allows the organizer to terminate the contract and transfer any remaining funds to their address by calling the `suicide(organizer)` function. This prevents funds from being locked in the contract forever.

Note: The use of the `throw` statement in this code is outdated, and in modern Solidity versions, it is replaced with `revert()` for handling exceptions.
